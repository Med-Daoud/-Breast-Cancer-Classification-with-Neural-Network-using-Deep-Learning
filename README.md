Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. This project uses a feedforward neural network to classify tumors as Malignant or Benign based on tumor features.

Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Cleaning, scaling, and preparing input features for the model.

Neural Network Model

A deep learning model built using Flatten and Dense layers.

Prediction

The model predicts the tumor type for new patient data.

Evaluation

Assessing model performance using metrics and visualizations.
